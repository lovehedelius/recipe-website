                <h3>What is Thought For Food?</h3>

                <p>Thought For Food is the result of a project in the course Dynamiska webbapplikationer at Uppsala 
                    University during the summer of 2025. The purpose of the site is to give users cooking inspiration 
                    when yet another meal has to be made. By going to the site and simply clicking the button on the 
                    home page you can instantly get a suggestion on what to make. You also get information about the 
                    approximate time it will take, the number of ingredients and the rating from people who have tried 
                    it, as well as a description and a picture of the dish. If you want vegetarian or vegan recipes you 
                    can choose to only randomise from those. Keep clicking the button until you find a recipe that looks 
                    good, and then click the recipe itself to see the ingredient list and the instructions.
                </p>

                <p>If you find a recipe you like but want to make another day, or you want to make sure you don't lose 
                    the one you have found before you are finished cooking, you can save it using a button. This is 
                    possible both from the overview on the home page and from the detailed recipe page. However, since 
                    the site is developed under the restrictions of the course project, the saved recipes are currently
                    not displayed under the Saved tab. They are nevertheless stored, and can be accessed by the user through
                    the console if desired.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>How it Works</h3>

                <p>All recipes and the information about them are fetched retrieved from <a href="https://tasty.co/">tasty.co</a>, 
                    with the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty">Tasty API</a> available through 
                    <a href="https://rapidapi.com/">RapidAPI</a>. The free subscription plan used for Thought For Food has a 
                    500 requests/month limit. There are therefore 40 pre-fetched recipes stored in one of the project files 
                    which can be used during testing or if the limit is reached, and also if the API becomes unavailable for 
                    other reasons. When using this database however, the filtering buttons have no effect.</p>

                <p>When the home page is loaded, a single request to the API is made to check the total number of available 
                    recipes. This is done to make sure all recipes can be reached and no nonexistent recipes are requested, 
                    since the number can change. A request is also made when the filter buttons are clicked, in order to check
                    the number of recipes satisfying the selected restriction. When the New Recipe button is clicked, a new 
                    request is made and a random recipe is picked. The contents of the recipe card are dynamically created 
                    with the information from the API and the data is also stored in sessionStorage. The recipe item is 
                    overwritten each time, and thus sessionStorage always contains the latest randomised recipe.</p>

                <p>Since the entire recipe card is a link, a click on it takes to user to the page for detailed recipes, and 
                    when that upon loading that page retrieves the recipe data from sessionStorage. Similarly to the recipe card, 
                    the page is then filled dynamically with the information about the recipe.</p>

                <p>The recipe card and the detailed recipe page both have buttons with which the current recipe is saved and 
                    unsaved. The saved recipes are stored in localStorage so that they are persistent across sessions but specific 
                    for each user. When the buttons are clicked, localStorage is checked to see if the recipe is already stored 
                    or not. The entire string of saved recipes is then retrieved from localStorage and converted to an array, 
                    the relevant recipe is added or removed from the array and the modified array is converted back to a string 
                    and sent to localStorage to replace the old item. If dynamic content had been allowed on more pages, the table 
                    on the Saved page would be filled by retrieving the saved recipes from localStorage and looping through them.</p>

                <h3>The Future of Thought For Food</h3>

                <p>There are several ways in which the functionality of the site could be extended. The most obvious is to implement
                    the saving feature fully, so that the saved recipes are displayed on the Saved page. Another potential improvement 
                    is to allow filtering based on more criteria then the recipes being vegetarian or vegan. The Tasty API provides a 
                    list of tags for each recipe, and this could be used to for example only get dishes that originate from a certain 
                    cuisine or that take less than a given amount of time to make. It would also be useful to be able to choose ingredients 
                    that the recipes should contain or find ones that are similar to some other recipe: features which are both supported 
                    by the API.</p>

                <p>Keep an eye out – Thought For Food might get even better soon!</p>

                <p>Love Hedelius is an engineering student at Lund University, graduating in 2026. With a background in mostly Java and 
                    Python, he has taken the course Dynamiska webbapplikationer both out of interest and to broaden his programming 
                    knowledge. He thinks it's very difficult to come up with ideas for what to cook every day.</p>
