This website was developed as the final project for the course Web Application Development at Uppsala University, which I took as a distance learning course in the summer of 2025. The task was to develop a food-related website which used an API to get some of the information to be displayed. The foucs of the course and the project was on well-structured HTML and CSS code following best practices, object-oriented JavaScript with API communication and DOM manipulation, and adherence to accesibility guidelines. There were several requirements and restrictions to comply with and therefore the result could not be exactly what I wanted it to be, most notable in the list of saved recipes which needed to be static instead of showing the actual recpies saved by the user. A contact form without function also had to be included for similar reasons.

Key features: 
- AJAX-style fetching of data from REST API based on user input, using HTTP and JSON.
- Dynamic creation of page content with external data using the DOM.
- Usage of sessionStorage and localStorage for temporary and persistent client-side data.
- Responsive design with flexible CSS layouts and media queries to adapt to different devices.
- Accessible webpages following WCAG 2.2 and Google guidelines for SEO.
